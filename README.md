# React Ecommerce Project

## Summary

This is a projects where I created a mock E-commerce store containing almost all the functionalities of a real store

## What I Applied In This Project

* Authentication (SignIn/Signout) feature using Firebase Authentication

* Storing new registered users in a Firestore database

* Client-side routing using react-router

* An "Add to cart" and "dropdown" functionality where users can add selected items to the cart

* A checkout component that displays all the selected items and shows a total amount

* Items classified in categories (Hats, Jackets, Sneakers, etc)

* CSS using the 'styled components' library

* React contexts to store the contexts of users, product categories, and the cart
